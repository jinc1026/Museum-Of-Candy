# Museum-Of-Candy

Mesum of Candy page was one of the core pojects of WebDevBootCamp and helped me to learn Bootstrap 4, HTML, CSS,
reponsive design, custom font integration and etc.

Throughout this project, I learned how to integrate a beautiful navigation bar using Bootstrap 4 which can collapse
based on the user's screen size. This feature was created using custom javascript code embeded at the bottom of the html page.
